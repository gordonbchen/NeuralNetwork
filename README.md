# NeuralNetwork
A neural network made from scratch in python.

## Information
This project was made for a junior year (high school) capstone project. 
I had a ton of fun doing this, and I'm excited to learn more about machine learning and neural networks.

### Note
mnist_vis.ipynb was made to create some visuals I used in this [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1eZDJilaFA1dAE4nX3d5W7WIeJfal1O2iPyJcsbjAGrc/edit?usp=sharing).
